# CSC120-FinalProject

The architecture diagram and a map of all routes in the game can be found [here](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?tags=%7B%7D&lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=CSC120%20Final%20Project%20Architecture.drawio&dark=auto#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1EUzs4jco-MmQYJOuMJLUEatxQLkz1VDW%26export%3Ddownload). The link contains:
1. The architecture diagram
2. A full-game route map
3. A route map of only Chapter I: The Hero and the Princess
4. A simplified full-game route map

(The route map isn't completely finished yet; all Chapter IIIs and Chapter II: The Adversary are currently unfinished.)
